I recently found out that the creator of OpenClaw, an open-source platform for personal AI agents, is from Europe.
When I found his blog, I really liked it, so I decided to create my own one.

In his blog, he writes that he rarely reads code anymore, but rather outsources coding to Claude Code and Codex.
So I was not surprised when hearing about safety issues with OpenClaw.
At the same time, I was surprised by how far you can get using coding agents in CLI.

Since I did not want to spend money and already had a Google AI Pro subscription, I tried Gemini CLI.
The tool is cool, but I could not use the latest model.
After letting it run for ~1h and occasionally giving feedback, I took a deeper look at @steipete's blog, I found out its code is open-source and the template is referenced (and open-source as well).

Instead of using coding agents, I just used this.
It's better to think first, and then let coding agents work for you.
