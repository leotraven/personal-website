<!-- Situation -> Complication -> Question -> Answer -->

### TL;DR:



### On the (un)importance of forecasts

- our lifes are determined by black swan events (as nassim taleb, author of books the black swan and antifragile, puts it)
- otherwise, progress is mostly incremental
- black swans can be positive or negative
- they carry an extreme impact
- example of black swan: transformer -> stepwise increase of performance of ai models -> massive amounts of capital -> further research and progress
- nothing in the past convincingly points to its possibility -> lies outside the realm of regular expectations -> can not be forecasted reliably
- after the event, human nature drives us to create reasonable explanations of why it was inevitable from the start
- in fact, it was not

### Focus on building learning systems
- instead of making decisions based on predictions, build systems that do not suffer, but profit from volatility
- use the barbell strategy: be extremely paranoid about 90% of your resources, use the other 10% of aggressive bets that have unlimited upside
- structure your system about asymmetric bets -> strive for a minimal downside and and exponential upside when becoming lucky
- example: go to a party -> your time investment is relatively small but you may find get to know interesting people
- build intentional redundancy
- this can be multiple streams of income or having cash reserves
- use fast, cheap tinkering -> agile development with short feedback circuits
- enforce skin in the game
- make sure people bear the consequences of their mistakes, by aligning risk and reward
- people will act much more responsibly if they are actually long term responsible, and not bailed out in bad times while receiving big bonuses in good times




- be sensitive to statistical measures - what information do you actually get?
- if the average room temperature of your flat over the last 10 hours was 20 degrees celcius, but the maximum value was 100 degrees and the minimum was -50 degrees, you might have a problem




- caveats: it might take more time than you have for this strategy to pay off - in the meantime, other people may have great success until they are wiped out by the next black swan
